During the Paragn\u0101 (Par. 6), the assistant priest consecrates the hair, which is tied on the (ritual) ring. Taking with his left hand the wire selected for the libation of the date palm cord, he places his left hand holding the wire on the two inverted cups nearest to him. With his right hand he picks up the bull\u2019s hair ring from its cup and repeatedly dips the ring into the water of the large container while reciting the 101 names of Ahura Mazd\u0101 in a low tone (Par. 6.2). This not only consecrates the bull\u2019s hair but also activates the power of the libation (MP <i>z\u014dhr</i>) used in all consequent ritual acts (Kotwal & Boyd 1991, 74). Having consecrated the bull\u2019s hair ring, the priest puts it back in its cup. <br/> The consecrated ring tied with bull\u2019s hair will be used to strain the Par\u0101h\u014dm (Par. 10.39-41). The priest puts the perforated saucer on top of the mortar and the bull\u2019s hair ring into the perforated saucer, and takes the libation cup in the left hand. While rubbing the finger of the right hand on the bull\u2019s hair ring and reciting the Avestan texts of Yasna 27.9-11, he slowly pours the libation water from the libation cup, which sits on top of the three-tiered structure, over the ring and through the perforated saucer into the mortar. He then pours the Par\u0101h\u014dm mixture from the h\u014dm cup through the perforated saucer containing the ring with bull\u2019s hair. In doing so, he first pours a small amount of par\u0101h\u014dm mixture onto the ritual table while saying the word <i>humata</i> \u2018good thoughts\u2019, then, while saying <i>h\u016bxta</i> \u2018good words\u2019, into the cup which sits on top of the three-tiered structure and which from then on is the Par\u0101h\u014dm cup, and then into the mortar while saying <i>huuar\u0161ta</i> \u2018good deeds\u2019. He repeats this action three times. Finally, he puts the perforated saucer containing the ring with bull\u2019s hair on top of the h\u014dm cup and pours the contents of the mortar over the ring with bull\u2019s hair through the strainer into the h\u014dm cup. He then moves the mortar to the southwestern part of the ritual table and puts the ring with bull\u2019s hair back into its cup, where it will remain until the end of the entire ritual. <br/> It is only in the Paragn\u0323\u0101 ritual that the H\u014dm juice is poured over the ring tied with bull\u2019s hair in the perforated saucer. In the Yasna proper the perforated saucer alone suffices for the h\u014dm straining section of the second and third preparations of the haoma drink in Y 22\u201327 and 31\u201334.

The latter would have been used in ancient Indo-Iranian times as a strainer when filtering the haoma drink. The presence of the hair of the animal on the ritual table symbolises the presence of the archetypical spiritual force of \u2018Good Thought\u2019 (Vohu Manah).

At this point, the priest fully covers the cup with the inverted saucer, and the cup remains so until the end of the ritual unless its contents are needed. The contents of the cup provide a reserve supply during the Yasna ceremony proper. For example, if a haoma twig accidentally falls on the ground during the Yasna, the priest can replace it with a twig from the reserve cup. In former times, the supply could also be used to remedy the ritual performance. Thus, Dhabhar (1932, 411f.) describes the situation if the Z\u014dt accidentally recites a stanza in excess. In order to make good the error, he pours a portion of the reserve Par\u0101h\u014dm into the main Par\u0101h\u014dm and then continues with the recitation. The use of the reserve Par\u0101h\u014dm here remedies an error in the recitation, but today this practice is no longer followed. At the end of the Yasna, the reserve Par\u0101h\u014dm, which usually remains unused in the ritual, is given to the laity, while the haoma and pomegranate twigs of the reserve cup are placed on the wood near the ritual fire to dry and, when dry, are fed to the fire.", "interpretation": "", "references": "Dhabhar, Ervad Bamaji Nusserwanji. 1932. <i>The Persian Rivayats of Hormazyar Framarz and others.

The fire is the focal point within the ritual precinct and a crucial instrument for achieving the efficacy of the ritual: a medium between mankind and god. Accordingly, the fire is often specifically addressed by the priests and is the subject of a litany (Y 62.1-10). In ancient times, meat oblations from a sacrificial victim were offered to the gods through the fire during the recitation of the Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti (Y 35-41), but of this practice only very faint traces remain in the Pahlavi literature. Until the 1950s-60s, in Iran, meat and fat oblations were still offered to the fire in a short ritual performed outside the temples and called <i>\u0100tax\u0161-z\u014dhr</i>, \u2018libation to the fire\u2019; in India, any meat offering disappeared from ritual during the 19<sup>th</sup> century.", "where_during_ritual": "The fire is usually kindled at the beginning of the Paragn\u0101 after the priests have said the Kusti prayers and before they go to the well to fetch water. The fire is taken by means of an oil lamp (Guj. <i>divo</i>) from the continually burning fire, if one is present in the fire temple, or else from any oil lamp (information kindly provided by Ervad Adil Bhesania). The fire is kept burning throughout the entire service: at defined points it is ceremonially fed, mostly by the assistant priest.", "interpretation": "The Old Iranian and Old Indian religions, as transmitted by the Avesta and the Vedas respectively, share, despite some differences, a common kernel of ritual practices and theological speculations. The use of fire in the ritual and its role as a bridge between the human and the divine worlds is one of these common features. As can be inferred from various references in the Rig-Veda, one (or more?) fire(s), on which the officiating priests pour liquid offerings to the gods, are the focal point(s) of the Vedic ritual precinct, and fire itself is a god, Agni, praised and exalted in many hymns. <br/> In the Zoroastrian Yasna, too, the ritual fire functions as an intermediary between the human and divine worlds. Because of its luminous nature, is said to be the visible and most beautiful manifestation of Ahura Mazd\u0101 (Y 36.6). The moment when the two facets of the fire as a divine being, on the one hand, and as a ritual implement, on the other, are present is Y 36.2, when the heavenly fire of Ahura Mazd\u0101 is addressed and invited to come and be present in the ritual fire. In Y 36.3 the fire is then addressed by its \u2018most life-giving\u2019 name, which is Av. <i>sp\u0259\u0304ni\u0161ta</i>-. To emphasize the close and intimate connection between the fire and Ahura Mazd\u0101, the ritual fire is repeatedly addressed as the \u2018son\u2019 (Av. <i>pu\u03d1ra</i>-) of Ahura Mazd\u0101. Moreover, fire is imagined as forever-burning until the final Renovation of the world (Y 62.3): every celebration of the Yasna has an eschatological meaning insofar as it brings closer this joyful moment. The Zoroastrian practice (attested at least from Parthian and Sasanian times, and maybe during the Achaemenid period, too) of keeping sacred, forever-burning fires enthroned in temples probably descended from such eschatological associations.", "references": "Boyce, Mary. 1966. \u0100ta\u0161-z\u014dhr and \u0100b-z\u014dhr. <i>Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland</i> (3\u20134). 100\u2013118. <br/> Boyce, Mary. 1989. \u0100ta\u0161. <i>Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica</i> (Vol. 3.1).

The assistant priest, with his left hand, takes a vase-like jug (Guj. <i>karas\u012bo</i>) with consecrated water from the niche and approaches the goat. He squats and, facing south, wipes the goat\u2019s udder with his right hand to clean it. While reciting the Avestan <i>x\u0161nao\u03d1ra</i>-mantra, he pours water three times from the jug over his right hand to consecrate it and with it the udder of the goat. Standing up, he recites Avestan texts in honour of the milk and of the goat and its soul and creator. He then squats again and first squirts a spray of milk on the ground and then a spray into the jug while reciting Avestan texts. The same double action is repeated twice. The priest then stands, passes his lower arm over the back of the goat, recites a mantra of blessing on all beneficent animals, returns to the consecrated ritual area, and places the jug containing the mixture of milk and consecrated water into the niche. At the end of the Paragn\u0101 (Par. 10.42.2), the assistant priest picks up the jug from the niche and pours the mixture from the jug into the saucer of goat\u2019s milk (Guj. <i>j\u012bv\u0101m ta\u0161ta</i>).", "function": "The function of the goat is to provide the milk required for the ritual.", "where_during_ritual": "The taking of the milk does not have a fixed place in the Paragn\u0101 ceremony except that it has to happen after the liturgical instruments have been consecrated and before the Yasna proper begins.", "interpretation": "The use of a single goat during the ritual is regarded as a particular Parsi practice. Among the Zoroastrians of Iran, the animal providing the milk could have been a cow or any other beneficent animal, such as a sheep, goat or mare, and more than one animal might have been present. If such was the case, the recitation text was adapted and the plural form of the personal pronoun was used instead of the singular (Kotwal & Boyd 1991, 71 fn.39; Kotwal & Choksy 2008). <br/> In order for the ritual to be efficacious, the goat providing the milk, just like the bull providing the hair, has to remain alive to the end of the ceremony. The milk is referred to in the Avesta as <i>g\u0105m j\u012buuii\u0105m</i>, which denotes the milk as being provided by the living animal. The animal that provided the milk, and by extension the milk itself, is seen as representing all beneficent animals and is associated with its spiritual counterpart, the Life-giving Immortal (Am\u01dd\u0161a Sp\u01ddnta) Good Thought (Vohu Manah). Therefore, a ritual is vitiated if the animal(s) providing <i>j\u012bw\u0101m</i> die(s) while the ritual for which the milk was taken is still in progress.", "references": "Cantera, Alberto. 2020.

Twigs of the plant are pressed in the Yasna ceremony to extract its juice. The botanical identity of the original plant is debated, but twigs of Ephedra are nowadays used in the Yasna ceremony. Ephedra is also a strong candidate for the plant used by the Indo-Iranians in prehistoric times.", "where_during_ritual": "In Par. 8.1 the assistant priest picks up five to seven haoma twigs. In the film he takes them from the back of his seat. This is a convenient method, which the priests have now adopted (Kotwal & Boyd 1991, 78). Alternatively, the twigs may be kept in a small metallic box in the niche in the wall (Kotwal & Boyd 1991, 66), from where the priest picks them up, washes both hands and returns to his seat. The H\u014dm twigs are pounded and mixed with consecrated water and pomegranate twigs in Par. 10. The juice produced is called Par\u0101h\u014dm, which will be drunk by the chief priest at the end of Y 11.10. The juice of H\u014dm is prepared two more times in the ritual during the recitation of Y 22-27 and Y 31-33. In these two subsequent preparations, the haoma twigs are pounded at Y 27.3-7, Y 31.5, 32.3 and 33.4 and, in contrast to the first one, the H\u014dm juice is mixed with milk. The drink prepared in the second and third pressings is not consumed during the ceremony. Instead, at the end of the ceremony (Y 72.16), part of the juice is poured into the well as a libation to the waters, and the remaining part is given to the person who ordered the ceremony.", "interpretation": "The text of Yasna 9-11 recounts that as a reward for pressing the plant, the deity Haoma brings his worshippers health, strength, healing, knowledge, and excellent offspring. In some passages of the Avesta and Rigveda, the Avestan noun <i>ma\u03b4a</i>- and its corresponding Vedic <i>mada</i>- \u2018exhilaration, exhilarating drink\u2019 also describe the properties of the plant. <br/> Unlike the oldest Vedic texts, in particular the Rigveda, where <i>s\u00f3ma</i>- abounds and an entire Book (Rigveda 9) is dedicated to it, the noun <i>haoma</i>- is absent from the G\u0101\u03d1\u0101s of Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra. Nonetheless, the attributes <i>d\u016brao\u0161a</i>- \u2018poor at burning\u2019 (Y 32.14) and <i>mada</i>- \u2018intoxicant\u2019 (Y 48.10), whose etymological cognates <i>dur\u00f3\u1e63a</i>- and <i>mada</i>- describe <i>s\u00f3ma</i>- in the Rigveda, do occur in the G\u0101\u03d1\u0101s, although each of them only once. There they are associated with rituals performed by Kauuis and Karapans, who are presented as being hostile to Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra. These stanzas have been traditionally regarded as showing Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra\u2019s opposition to the Haoma ritual (Rose 2011, 15). According to Yasna 32.14, a Kauui is someone \u2018who makes D\u016brao\u0161a blaze\u2019 (<i>y\u01dd\u0304 d\u016brao\u0161\u01ddm saocaiiat</i>). However, as noted by Flattery & Schwartz (1989, II 106), nothing is said here about the rejection of the use of haoma in the ritual. Furthermore, it cannot be taken for granted that <i>d\u016brao\u0161a</i>- in Yasna 32.14 stands for <i>haoma</i>-. The close connection between the adjective and fire is also found in the Rigveda, where the Vedic cognate <i>dur\u00f3\u1e63a</i>- \u2018hard to kindle\u2019 describes Agni \u2018fire\u2019 (RV 4.21.6; Kellens & Pirart 1991, 92). <br/> As regards Yasna 48.10, the meaning of the hemistich in which <i>mada</i>- occurs is disputed among scholars. It occurs in a context which contrasts the rituals performed by a Mazda-worshipping <i>sao\u0161iiant</i>- \u2018redeemer\u2019 (literally: \u2018one who will be strong\u2019) with those performed by Karapans. According to Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8 (2004, 272-273), Yasna 48.9-12 implies that while the performer (<i>par excellence</i>) of the Haoma ritual performs an efficient ceremony, the ritual performed by Karapans is inefficient. <br/> Moreover, Skj\u00e6rv\u00f8 (2015, 420) suggests that Haoma is encrypted in Yasna 29.7 since the ingredients of its ritual are attested; Av. <i>\u0101zuiti</i>- \u2018fat (for libation)\u2019, <i>m\u0105\u03d1ra</i>- \u2018sacred utterance\u2019 and <i>x\u0161uu\u012bd</i>- \u2018milk\u2019. Following these arguments, we may conclude that there are indications in the G\u0101\u03d1\u0101s that, rather than being rejected, the Haoma ritual is regarded as a weapon against the evil forces.", "references": "For a review on the botanical identity of Avestan <i>haoma</i>-, Vedic <i>s\u00f3ma</i>- see: <br/> Clark, Matthew. 2017. <i>The Tawny One: Soma, Haoma and Ayahuasca</i>.

It is the name of both a text and a ritual.  The priests recite the Avestan text of the Yasna by heart while they perform the ritual.", "description_of_action": "The text of the Yasna is divided into 73 sections, consisting of an introductory section 0 and 72 sections. In the film, the structure of the text follows that of the edition of Geldner 1896. At the end, Y 72.11\u201316, which are recited after the conclusion of the main ritual and when the priests go to pour some of the haoma-libation into the temple well, have been added, as these verses are not included in Geldner\u2019s edition. The 72 sections of the Yasna are symbolically represented by the 72 strands from which the sacred girdle of the Zoroastrians, the <i>kusti</i>, is woven. Until around the 1970s the performance of the full ritual was available in both Iran and India, but today it is only practised in India in its full form. However, an abbreviated version of the Yasna ceremony is still found in Iran. <br/> The ritual is performed by Zoroastrian priests in a Zoroastrian fire temple. The performance requires the presence of two priests, the chief priest (MP <i>z\u014dt</i>) and the assistant priest (<i>rasp\u012bg</i> in Middle Persian, <i>r\u0101thv\u012b</i> in Gujarati). In the film, Ervad Adil Bhesania of the Wadia Atesh Behram, Mumbai acts as chief priest while Ervad Asfandiarji Dadachanji of the Vachha Gandhi Agiary, Mumbai performs as the assistant priest. The main duty of the assistant priest is to tend the ritual fire, participate in the recitation at certain points, and assist the chief priest in the performance of the ritual actions. The main duty of the chief priest is to carry out the ritual actions and to recite the Avestan text of the Yasna. The main ritual actions include the consumption of the ritual bread (MP <i>dr\u014dn</i>) in Y 8.4 and of the haoma drink (MP <i>par\u0101h\u014dm</i>) in Y 11.10, and two further preparations of the haoma drink, this time mixed with milk, in Y 22\u201327 and Y 31\u201334 respectively. <br/> The Avestan text recited in the Yasna ceremony comprises texts of different periods, which scholars term Old, Middle and Young Avestan (abbreviated OAv., MAv., YAv.). The most archaic of these texts are the five G\u0101th\u0101s, or \u2018hymns\u2019, and the Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti, the \u2018Sacrifice in Seven Sections\u2019. This Old Avestan body of texts constitutes Y 28\u201354, thus forming the middle part of the Yasna ceremony. Being attributed to Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra, the G\u0101th\u0101s are foundational to the entire religion. They precede and follow the Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti (Y 35\u201341), which sits at the centre of the entire ceremony. The Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti in turn has the features of a self-contained ceremony with an introductory, middle and concluding section and may have been the liturgical core of the entire Yasna ritual. The predominantly Young Avestan sections Y 0\u201327 and in Y 55\u201372 respectively precede and follow the Old Avestan middle part, but there are also numerous quotations of Old Avestan texts in the Young Avestan portions. Passages such as the Frauuar\u0101ne in Y 12 and the \u2018Mantra of the Cattle-Breeder\u2019 in Y 58 are in Middle Avestan, whose language shows more archaic features than Young Avestan. <br/> The recitation text of the Yasna is constituted by the following parts: <br/> Y 0 Introductory part <br/> Y 1 Invitation of all divine beings <br/> Y 2 Barsom Ya\u0161t <br/> Y 3\u20138 Sr\u014d\u0161 Dr\u014dn <br/> Y 9\u201311 H\u014dm Ya\u0161t <br/> Y 12\u201313 Frauuar\u0101ne <br/> Y 14\u201318 Invocations and praises <br/> Y 19\u201321 Commentaries on the three sacred prayers <br/> Y 22\u201327 Invocations and praises <br/> Y 28\u201334 G\u0101th\u0101 1 (Ahunauuait\u012b) <br/> Y 35\u201341 Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti <br/> Y 42 Praise of the Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti (in Young Avestan) <br/> Y 43\u201346 G\u0101th\u0101 2 (U\u0161tauuait\u012b) <br/> Y 47\u201350 G\u0101th\u0101 3 (Spentamainiiu) <br/> Y 51 G\u0101th\u0101 4 (Vohux\u0161athr\u0101) <br/> Y 52 Invocations and praises (in Young Avestan) <br/> Y 53 G\u0101th\u0101 5 (Vahi\u0161t\u014di\u0161ti) <br/> Y 54 Ariiaman I\u0161iia prayer <br/> Y 55 Praises of the G\u0101th\u0101s and the Staota Yesniia <br/> Y 56\u201357 Sr\u014d\u0161 Ya\u0161t <br/> Y 58 Mantra of the Cattle Breeder <br/> Y 59 Invocations and praises <br/> Y 60 Benediction of the House (<i>dahma \u0101friti\u0161</i>) <br/> Y 61 Praises of the anti-demonic powers of the sacred prayers <br/> Y 62 Praise of the Fire (\u0100ta\u0161 Niy\u0101yi\u0161n) <br/> Y 63\u201369 Libation of the Water (\u0100b Z\u014dhr) <br/> Y 70\u201372 Concluding praises.", "function": "The function of the performance of the Yasna ritual is to strengthen Ahura Mazd\u0101, the \u2018Life-giving Immortals\u2019 (Amesha Spentas) and all spiritual and material beings made by Ahura Mazd\u0101. In doing so, the power of Evil in the world is reduced. <br/> The 73 sections of the Yasna form the basis of another high ritual, the Visperad ceremony, which includes the entire Yasna but with distinctive textual variations and, most importantly, interleaves it at different fixed points with 24 additional chapters which are specific to the Visperad. The text of the Visperad ceremony also includes a second recitation of the entire Yasna Hapta\u014bh\u0101iti between G\u0101th\u0101 4 (Y 51) and 5 (Y 53) and passages of the Visperad. <br/> The Visperad in turn forms the base text of two more high rituals. One of them is the V\u012bd\u0113vd\u0101d, the longest of all. It entails further textual variations and the insertion, into the Visperad, of all 22 sections specific to the V\u012bd\u0113vd\u0101d. The V\u012bd\u0113vd\u0101d ceremony starts at midnight. It is still practised in India, but no longer in Iran. During ritual performances, the Parsi priests usually read the chapters of the V\u012bd\u0113vd\u0101d sections from large manuscripts, while the text of the Visperad as described above and on which the V\u012bd\u0113vd\u0101d ceremony is based, is recited by heart. Priests are trained to memorise the text of the Yasna and the Visperad ceremonies and learn to read the Avestan text of the V\u012bd\u0113vd\u0101d. <br/> The other ritual based on the Visperad is the Vi\u0161t\u0101sp Ya\u0161t, whose eight sections are inserted at specified points. But we know of the Vi\u0161t\u0101sp Ya\u0161t ceremony only from written sources because its performance has died out in India as well as in Iran.", "where_during_ritual": "", "interpretation": "Zoroastrians have always held the Yasna in very high esteem because it includes at its centre the five G\u0101th\u0101s of Zara\u03d1u\u0161tra.
