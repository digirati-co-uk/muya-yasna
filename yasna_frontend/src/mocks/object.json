  "definition": "The ritual fire is kept burning throughout the ceremony.",
  "description_of_action": "Placed on a fire-table (MP. ātaš-xwān) the fire burns on a flat plate, which sits on top of a fire-vase (PGuj. āfrīngānyu). During the ceremony, the priest offers hard and soft fragrant wood in the form of sandalwood and frankincense (MP. ēsm-bōy) to the fire .",
  "function": "The fire plays a central role in the Yasna ceremony, and indeed in all Zoroastrian rituals. Its dignity is visualised and enhanced by its elevated position in the southern area of the ritual precinct.",
  "where_during_ritual": "The fire is kindled at the beginning of the ceremony and is kept burning througout. It is ceremonially fed by the assistant priest at defined points during the ritual.",
  "interpretation": "The fire's dignity is enhanced by its elevated position at the south end of the ritual precinct, the direction of goodness and bounty. It is a crucial instrument for achieving the efficacy of the ritual.  During the recitation of Y 36.6, the ritual fire is addressed as the most beautiful visible form of Ahura Mazdā. It is the epiphany of Ahura Mazdā and also the principle of energy that animates the entire creation. It it  also regarded as the son and physical representative of Ahura Mazdā on earth. Offering sandalwood to the fire reduces the power of evil that pervades the world. The ritual fire is metaphysically linked to the fire that will purify all impurities in the world at the end of time when the world will be made perfect at the final Renovation (frashegird).",
